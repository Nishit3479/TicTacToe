# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game made using Java

Here in the code we have an option to choose which process we want to use to check whether the game has been completed i.e., won by 'X' or 'O' or has been drawn.
All the three files are required to be implemented in a single package.

Any doubts/queries regarding the codes? 
Feel free to ping me up anytime. I will try my best to get that resolved.
